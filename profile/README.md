## Reliable [Freedom Software](https://www.vdm.io/gnu-gpl)

Here you can find many software that **VDM** maintains and/or uses.
These software projects are presented in what is called **git repositories**.
Git, alongside an issues system, helps developers and end users to easily read the code,
and communicate in a collaborative way to improve and extend these projects in a productive way.

You are welcome to [join us today](https://git.vdm.dev/user/login), as we share our journey with you.
Please keep all conversations and collaboration respectful and polite.

#### GIV'ED = GIT + OCTOLEO + VDM
